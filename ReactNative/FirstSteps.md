## Creating a Basic React-APP for PWA:
($ = Sign to  show that we work in terminal)


// install the 'create-react-app' library globaly to use it after:

    $ npm install -g create-react-app


// now we can create an app "xyz" is the name that you can give your project:

    $ create-react-app xyz


// not using yarn, we use NPM -> we built the base... now lets convert it to a complete offline pwa:
( for that we have to make some files available because they are hidden by default example: registerServiceWorker.js -> lets change that.This eject process in not reversible)

    $ npm run eject


// Now check your folder and you see a lot more folders an files
// lets bring it PWA now:

    $ npm run build


// look to it in the browser as a  simulation (testing-purpose) #notToDeploy:

    $ npm install -g serve


//  Lets test it:

    $ serve -s build 


Congratulation... you did it -> a single side pwa.

You can visit either of the links shown in the terminal to see the build:

    https: localhost:5000

We are using our own precache strategy, so we have to use $ importScript[]  in the generated sw-precache file
